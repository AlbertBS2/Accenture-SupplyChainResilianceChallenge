## I. Introduction

This repository details a case study on supply chain resilience using data from a European fashion retailer provided by Accenture. It aims to determine how likely it is for an order not to reach the customer on time. The project was created at [Datathon FME 2022](https://datathon.cat/).

## II. Installation

After cloning the repository to your local machine, you first need to download the data from Accenture from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/datathon-2022-upc-accenture/data) (Kaggle account required). The path to cities_data.csv should then look something like data/datathon_SC_ACN_22/cities_data.csv. Then install all necessary dependencies. After that, run the notebook "Main.ipynb".
